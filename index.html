<p> Project description: I hope to compare the use of data sourced from 
<a href=”https://www.gbif.org/” target=”_blank”>GBIF</a> and the the <a href=”http://www.iucnredlist.org/” target=”_blank”>IUCN Red List</a>, 
as well as citizen science data from sources such as <a href=”https://www.flickr.com/” target=”_blank”>Flickr</a> 
and <a href=”https://www.inaturalist.org/” target=”_blank”>iNaturalist</a>, to produce maps of the distribution of Asian Elephants on software 
such as <a href=”http://geocat.kew.org/” target=”_blank”>GeoCAT</a> and Google Earth.</p>


<h2>Distribution of Asian Elephants</h2>


<p><strong>GeoCAT:</strong> I used <a href=”http://geocat.kew.org/” target=”_blank”>GeoCAT</a> to spatially analyse data collected from GBIF, Flickr and iNaturalist. 
The user interface is relatively straight forward, although the help pages were useful. GeoCAT allows you to plot the spatial distribution of a species
of your choosing, whilst searching for data from a variety of sources, or uploading your own. Furthermore, the map produced is interactive, and 
further analysis, such as the 'Extent of Occurrence' and 'Area of Occupancy', can be calculated and projected onto the map. These calculations 
also come with an IUCN Red List categorisation (least concern, endangered, etc...). The data from this map can then be downloaded in a variety 
of forms, including .CSV, however, I choose to download as .kml in order to plot the data within Google Earth. When downloading this data, any 
projections you made also come with it, which allowed me to plot the area of Asian Elephant occurrences found by iNaturalist users.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPAuSjpK1R-HLHLVyFapQIKJfe01J57NM0VbXLQOeCY_Ndh1DXlA3BhnF6OCMmSdg?key=NXE3TDhyd3V6andQNlV1OE1VaHF0Yng1Uk0yLXF3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PbUXwbX55kak1uxITG9Cb40PyWCg6CWw1MwaUnZoeHgpARW6mA2TQ7hyCZeSURTuKGCRX_fraRKWGX4' /></a></p>

<p><strong>GBIF data:</strong> GBIF is an online source containing millions of records of species that have been recorded, often with 
the geographic coordinates, meaning they are a great source of data for spatial analysis.</p>

<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPOeK1_tsxuDBqP6OI0izs6GBlFJ2tNKxq4NDVJ2Tk_Dr5IdXkVWphWRQrKn8Mtiw?key=WWxkNWdaa2FwNTRFOFZEMGcxOExnbHRZVFpxd2x3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YY14PhhJDkqQezIdCQKRHACzMUPCnbFMgN7m6WzKKuNBMODTaaOLQ4QCqexFVY6IzUwyXGhh8BaoB2sjFvLYQ6CGZYSZDe8oqsh2nsTmJkvpPAVVFxN8rKIqf-W_RSoGy2ELnthr' /></a></p>

<p>The data shown by GBIF had the elephants placed on the map largely where they would be expected, in Southeast Asia. However, 
there were a notable number found across Europe and North America, which may be the result of museum/zoo specimens being recorded. Here, it may be useful 
to clean the data on the map to ensure that these points are not visible. GeoCAT does provide tools to do this, however, each point must be removed 
individually, which may prove tedious when working with large datasets, which contain many data points recorded in areas where the species would not occur 
naturally. Therefore, it may prove useful to separate recordings on GBIF to natural sightings and museum/zoo specimens to avoid confusion when producing maps. </p>


<p><strong>IUCN Red List:</strong> This data was not offered through GeoCAT, and had to be downloaded through the IUCN Red List site, where it could 
be found on the map screen.</p> 

<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMsRHVdpZe8umD0Anp0SnaD0DiOCZCa7HPMDAnesTd8RI8e7HXJLI3JKf5C0WRjTQ?key=YVdURDdmelNaYUVoaF9TQWhQbmxLSnVRRng4azdB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2TquTM_OLT1DBJ7A2yCetvJp6MyFlvJymkGfmVrhfWyo9528g9eekosw7F0o4P5xJMiTT6JPiLR3wP8' /></a></p>
<p> Above is the map of Asian Elephant distributions produced by the site, showing them placed largely in India, Myanmar and Malaysia.</p>
<p>However, data was not easy to get a hold of, requiring log-ins, and accepting terms and conditions.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNf9vBsjfYwV72L4E78LUtqkPGBZg9iBRlqSI2Osu8FMC5f-06lQp727I9mt09Vsg?key=WHFGUWRjS29LczgteXpLLW5mMVFXd1Nhc0EzMzhn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3dHrw05DABXyclsod4aCbHIn4PBCl5sWcXi4sZTOpbaJ9ZRCQ-GjUUSOuWyORPnAZJfhUAYJd_nMkoY' /></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, the data was provided in a form that could not be uploaded to GeoCAT (.csv files), as it is intended for use in GIS software, which many may not have access to.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPFfDiirpiMSZhYwK8JQmYIuqqFtMXaV-W0q5hV0KVVVBe4emSaqyQPqYB1bUFyWg?key=cUY2X2xJX2VjTmdaaW5BMk5COG1VQm1NLVZxZklB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WQrGrkNuk99vR89BcugiRwx58gra27Yu3uWGoaPtsIFm6HtEISOaQckv52Al5gzeTuWz1Xd_wVCdDTQ' /></a></p>
<p>However, a shapefile was included with the data, and this could be used to map the distributions onto Google Earth.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMzx7lbJ8OiQ01QM9ARTTB_IM3z6MKwKuJjyD_Gh9OvyWru6emySfv__iK6ofToMA?key=ZHBtSGNPOWhIUlVralB1YjRhdzhKc19nYnlFYktn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KmFpo9B-ylES0lwELKJD7qLyZTntUGJJS1Llj4lA2rglNePnV-_3a9QN-qOHX5RJzSvGdPsuyS-3aLA' /></a></p>
<p>Here you can see that the distributions plotted onto Google Earth are the same as those produced by the map on the IUCN's webpage, however, each area
of distribution has been given its own colour here. Therefore, although data is hard to get hold of, the maps produced from it
are largely reliable, and give very accurate maps of their distribution</p>
	
<h2>Using citizen science data</h2>

<p> Citizen science data is proving increasingly powerful, and useful, to ecologists,
with various tools available, including apps, such as iNaturalist. Here, two sources of citizen science data were used, Flickr and iNaturalist. Flickr provides a 
wealth of data, however, this goes unchecked, as there is no moderator ensuring that photos tagged as a specific species are indeed the species they are claiming to be. 
iNaturalist is a social network of both citizen scientists and biologists, allowing users to upload photos and locations of species they come across, mapping 
biodiversity across the globe. Observations have to be approved to then be mapped. </p>

<p><strong>Flickr:</strong> Flickr was the most abundant source of information of those offered on the GeoCat mapping interface. However, you only have the option to 
upload the first 1000 observations to the map. Furthermore, although many of these observations are seen where Asian elephants would be expected, </p>

<p><strong>iNaturalist:</strong> The iNaturalist data did not appear to include specimens found in zoos and museums, as all recordings were taken within 
the species natural range. Therefore, this data may prove more reliable when mapping the distribution of the species in the wild. </p>

<h2>Using Google Earth</h2>
<p>GeoCat alls you to download the data you have been working with in .kml format, which allows you to then plot the information directly onto Google Earth. Furthermore,
this allows you to collate your data with data you may not have been able to upload to your GeoCat map, such as the shapefile data retrieved from the IUCN website. 
Therefore, this allows further direct comparisons of data.</>
