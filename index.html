<p><strong>Project description:</strong> I hope to compare the use of data sourced from 
<a href=”https://www.gbif.org/” target=”_blank”>GBIF</a> and the the <a href=”http://www.iucnredlist.org/” target=”_blank”>IUCN Red List</a>, 
as well as citizen science data from sources such as <a href=”https://www.flickr.com/” target=”_blank”>Flickr</a> 
and <a href=”https://www.inaturalist.org/” target=”_blank”>iNaturalist</a>, to produce maps of the distribution of Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) on software 
such as <a href=”http://geocat.kew.org/” target=”_blank”>GeoCAT</a> and Google Earth.</p>


<h2>Mapping the Distribution of Asian Elephants</h2>


<p><strong>GeoCAT:</strong> I used <a href=”http://geocat.kew.org/” target=”_blank”>GeoCAT</a> to spatially analyse data collected from a variety of sources, including, GBIF, Flickr and iNaturalist. Other sources listed on the import panel 
	include Picassa, however, this is has been retired and replaced with <a href=”https://photos.google.com/” target=”_blank”>Google Photos</a>, and GeoCAT has yet to be updated to reflect this. Furthermore, GeoCAT allows you to upload your 
	own data (in .csv format), which may prove useful when producing your own maps for projects, or ensuring that you are using reliable recordings, instead of relying on open source data.
The user interface is relatively straight forward, although the help pages were required to understand some of the functions. GeoCAT allows you to plot the spatial distribution of a species
of your choosing, using the previously mentioned sources. Furthermore, the map produced is interactive, and 
further analysis, such as the 'Extent of Occurrence' and 'Area of Occupancy', can be calculated and projected onto the map. These calculations 
also come with an IUCN Red List categorisation (least concern, endangered, etc...). The data from this map can then be downloaded in a variety 
of forms, including .csv, however, I choose to download as .kml in order to plot the data within Google Earth. When downloading this data, any 
projections you made also come with it, which allowed me to plot the area of Asian Elephant occurrences found by iNaturalist users.</p>
<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPAuSjpK1R-HLHLVyFapQIKJfe01J57NM0VbXLQOeCY_Ndh1DXlA3BhnF6OCMmSdg?key=NXE3TDhyd3V6andQNlV1OE1VaHF0Yng1Uk0yLXF3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PbUXwbX55kak1uxITG9Cb40PyWCg6CWw1MwaUnZoeHgpARW6mA2TQ7hyCZeSURTuKGCRX_fraRKWGX4' /></a></p>

<p><strong>Google Earth:</strong> Although not specifically desinged for spatial distribution analysis, as with GeoCAT, 
	Google Earth provides a free, powerful tool for mapping species distributions. Mapping species occurances requires the use of .kml files, 
	or shapefiles (.shp) to imput data to the software. Here, using GeoCAT to source your data allows a .kml file to be produced, 
	which can then be imported into Google Earth, where the data can then be compared with other sources that may not have been 
	useable through GeoCAT.</p>
	
	<h2>Using Scientific Data</h2>
	
<p><strong>GBIF data:</strong> GBIF is an online source containing millions of records of species that have been recorded, often with 
the geographic coordinates, meaning they are a great source of data for spatial analysis.</p>

<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPOeK1_tsxuDBqP6OI0izs6GBlFJ2tNKxq4NDVJ2Tk_Dr5IdXkVWphWRQrKn8Mtiw?key=WWxkNWdaa2FwNTRFOFZEMGcxOExnbHRZVFpxd2x3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YY14PhhJDkqQezIdCQKRHACzMUPCnbFMgN7m6WzKKuNBMODTaaOLQ4QCqexFVY6IzUwyXGhh8BaoB2sjFvLYQ6CGZYSZDe8oqsh2nsTmJkvpPAVVFxN8rKIqf-W_RSoGy2ELnthr' /></a></p>

<p>Using data sourced from GBIF, GeoCAT was able to find 171 recordings. The data has the elephants placed on the map largely where they would be expected, in Southeast Asia. However, 
there were a notable number found across Europe and North America, shown on the map below. These may be the result of recordings taken from  museum or zoo specimens.</p> 
<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPF2CosIy5IKGK5xBN29Ja51gVGhGZKCgH_a08vpkNrP2mqt6ZpNVdlXyAxIO0Ljg?key=OWg1aFh6OUNET0FrbmpLc0ZGM2FXbDg5dmRHM0t3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i7SsZJvlx36VG2zWPfN1l4inpIk1ir6eN5kTMQVyuIbySA_2LaDBO8aK5D_yEPlmHeb2rKqKwUMEIIn4' /></a></p>
<p>Therefore, it may be useful to clean the data on the map to ensure that these points are not visible. GeoCAT does provide tools to do this, however, each point must be removed 
individually, which may prove tedious when working with large datasets containing many data points recorded in areas where the species would not occur 
naturally. Therefore, it may prove useful to separate recordings on GBIF to recordings in the wild and museum/zoo specimens to avoid confusion when producing maps, as this may lead to incorrect 
IUCN categorisations for the endangered status of the species being produced.</p>


<p><strong>IUCN Red List:</strong> This data was not offered through GeoCAT, and had to be downloaded through the IUCN Red List site, where it could 
be found on the map screen.</p> 

<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMsRHVdpZe8umD0Anp0SnaD0DiOCZCa7HPMDAnesTd8RI8e7HXJLI3JKf5C0WRjTQ?key=YVdURDdmelNaYUVoaF9TQWhQbmxLSnVRRng4azdB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2TquTM_OLT1DBJ7A2yCetvJp6MyFlvJymkGfmVrhfWyo9528g9eekosw7F0o4P5xJMiTT6JPiLR3wP8' /></a><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNf9vBsjfYwV72L4E78LUtqkPGBZg9iBRlqSI2Osu8FMC5f-06lQp727I9mt09Vsg?key=WHFGUWRjS29LczgteXpLLW5mMVFXd1Nhc0EzMzhn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3dHrw05DABXyclsod4aCbHIn4PBCl5sWcXi4sZTOpbaJ9ZRCQ-GjUUSOuWyORPnAZJfhUAYJd_nMkoY' /></a></p>
<p> Above is the map of Asian Elephant distributions produced by the site, showing them placed largely in India, Myanmar and Malaysia, with the location for access to the spatial data.</p>
<p>However, data was not easy to get a hold of, requiring log-ins, and accepting terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the data was provided in a form that could not be uploaded to GeoCAT (.csv files), as it is intended for use in GIS software, which many may not have access to.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPFfDiirpiMSZhYwK8JQmYIuqqFtMXaV-W0q5hV0KVVVBe4emSaqyQPqYB1bUFyWg?key=cUY2X2xJX2VjTmdaaW5BMk5COG1VQm1NLVZxZklB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WQrGrkNuk99vR89BcugiRwx58gra27Yu3uWGoaPtsIFm6HtEISOaQckv52Al5gzeTuWz1Xd_wVCdDTQ' /></a></p>
<p>However, a shapefile was included with the data, and this could be used to map the distributions onto Google Earth.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNqL2Xh8ekP0wpy4C7oBCZWaAihrpFStc7VElDxoJTN4uQ-KVv9NFSqzkhBzXj50w?key=NXBCNEU5VXJwdWZaa3pRb0xBdGZ4eG1XSmh3X2Jn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OGFkzzoU73CQGyxoqZi0cEqv_CQcF8uK0H_GGBxmVW8QWwbdO8JqhbsR7-lbk1fdJGrXHss1zVaZV-l2NGl_Nwj1pDnuingvsxgAFd47oF3PtZkbYI6liArtnNJsmYAHA7yPIROmZw' /></a></p>
<p>Here you can see that the distributions plotted onto Google Earth are the same as those produced by the map on the IUCN's webpage, however, each area
of distribution has been given its own colour here. Therefore, although data is hard to get hold of, the maps produced from it
are largely reliable, and give very accurate maps of their distribution</p>
	
<h2>Using citizen science data</h2>

<p> Citizen science data is proving increasingly powerful, and useful, to ecologists,
with various tools available, including app-based approaches, such as iNaturalist. Here, two sources of citizen science data were used, Flickr and iNaturalist. Flickr provides a 
wealth of data, however, this goes unchecked, as there is no moderator ensuring that photos tagged as a specific species are indeed the species they are claiming to be. 
iNaturalist is a social network of both citizen scientists and biologists, allowing users to upload photos and locations of species they come across, mapping 
biodiversity across the globe. Observations have to be approved to then be mapped, providing more reliable locations. </p>

<p><strong>Flickr:</strong> Flickr was the most abundant source of information of those offered on the GeoCat mapping interface, with over 1000 observations of the species being recorded. However, you only have the option to 
upload the first 1000 observations to the map, which may limit the power of the data.</p>
<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN6OAZYbf-ELZRmHJB3GNrAKGQvL773H4LXM5Dy8_hQYx0RkPWCQZLFO_AKiKlNmA?key=VG1OcTRBTnBIR3hWN2tGQTZLZ1hmMjJEM1FPSFlR&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nz2d-eFi7Y8oE2Js0FhqCHt-JVp4SzhLViTbO6wKKH77isIiXdQAg8YfaU9YGkQbXS0D2Oz6sUuJwVDw' /></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, although many of these observations are seen where Asian elephants would be expected, as the above map shows, there were a very large number 
recorded across Europe, North America, and even Australia. Therefore, these recordings are likely to have come from zoo or museum specimens, and maps produced
using this data are likely to give unreliable results when using the analysis features provided by GeoCAT.</p>

<p><strong>iNaturalist:</strong> The GeoCAT mapping tool found 94 occurances for Elephas maximus sourced from iNaturalist. The iNaturalist data did not appear to include specimens found in zoos and museums, as all recordings were taken within 
	the species natural range.</p>
<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNtZbpzAogzh9JdY65M8dLtpoQXSq-2mchl0kq2WnuTVCoRR1z3_X7H5ft4FPz2tw?key=d1lhOG5TeGRwTlV6T3NBOHJFNGVVdktWaWcwcFRn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c1NJmWYk304ylQzWzdYIDwspAdwqGOZ-GyMHQB4dLzOgEcPpODKs6UxGGdyx4zSU38jE4q7Jiq780PC4' /></a></p>
<p>Therefore, this data may prove more reliable when mapping the distribution of the species in the wild. Furthermore, the analysis feature 
	on GeoCAT worked nicely for this set of data, producing results for the extent of their occurance, and their area of occupancy</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMUCyRhlTg_NIL1KmbI5crDVRu40EV3_KxkOI8cQqnM6X-eE3T0MEi551jEfLGNzw?key=eEdOVWZ0b1oxWC1sWUJ3SThBdWJkOWRtc3FOa0J3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yhKpsGqvrODeuuOSdOrgsm3wsiRax-OZEp58mYhW3qvza8YK1rIYbn2W_yl7tScPw9aKmcCcMFbfTqv2' /></a><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPvAitb6ITKazjltvS__xXr3f5An6vcG6Gojloy1K4yZ_5d_kVLekbjaRQpg3UMkw?key=d2JSNjFhXzg3R0xmSGUyUlhSZlNMLVlxMEZ3cGVB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eIYNbjbn4s17d0cl93Pe3EsRtB13jPdZkKEslGR1eb4RAcTa4efoCaJr1sSoU6fwT9YNPXp8FUR5Utmu' /></a></p>

<h2>Comparing data on Google Earth</h2>
<p>GeoCat alls you to download the data you have been working with in .kml format, which allows you to then plot the information directly onto Google Earth. Furthermore,
this allows you to collate your data with data you may not have been able to upload to your GeoCat map, such as the shapefile data retrieved from the IUCN website. 
Therefore, this allows further direct comparisons of data.</>
