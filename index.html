<p><strong>Project description:</strong> Diversity and distribution data for millions of recorded species can now be found from a wide range of sources. These can include both
	scientific sources, such as the IUCN red list and GBIF, to newly emerging citizen science sources, such as iNaturalist. 
	Combining data from a range of sources may provide more accurate information on the distribution and habitat ranges of 
	potentially vulnerable species, which can be collated and mapped quickly and efficiently across a variety of platforms, such 
	as Google Earth. Therefore, I hope to compare the use of data sourced from 
<a href=”https://www.gbif.org/” target=”_blank”>GBIF</a> and the <a href=”http://www.iucnredlist.org/” target=”_blank”>IUCN Red List</a>, 
as well as citizen science data from sources such as <a href=”https://www.flickr.com/” target=”_blank”>Flickr</a> 
and <a href=”https://www.inaturalist.org/” target=”_blank”>iNaturalist</a>, to produce maps of the distribution of Asian Elephants <i>(Elephas maximus)</i> on software 
such as <a href=”http://geocat.kew.org/” target=”_blank”>GeoCAT</a> and Google Earth. Using a variety of sources may produce more accurate maps,
	as well as highlight certain limitations when relying on citizen science data, or those from published studies. </p>


<h2>Mapping the Distribution of Asian Elephants</h2>


<p><strong>GeoCAT:</strong> <a href=”http://geocat.kew.org/” target=”_blank”>GeoCAT</a>, by Kew Botanical Gardens, is a tool primarily designed to map the spatial distribution 
	of species, and assess their IUCN Red List category based on the results. I used GeoCAT to spatially analyse data collected from a variety of sources, including, GBIF, Flickr and iNaturalist, which can be accessed directly through the interface.
	Other sources listed on the import panel 
	include Picassa, however, this is has been retired and replaced with <a href=”https://photos.google.com/” target=”_blank”>Google Photos</a>, and GeoCAT has yet to be updated to reflect this. Furthermore, GeoCAT allows you to upload your 
	own data (in .csv format), which may prove useful when producing maps for personal projects, or ensuring that you are using reliable recordings, instead of relying on open source data.
The user interface is relatively straight forward, although the help pages were required to understand some of the functions. GeoCAT allows you to plot the spatial distribution of a species
of your choosing, using the previously mentioned sources. Furthermore, the map produced is interactive, and 
further analysis, such as the 'Extent of Occurrence' and 'Area of Occupancy', can be calculated and projected onto the map. These calculations 
also come with an IUCN Red List categorisation (least concern, endangered, etc...). The data from this map can then be downloaded in a variety 
of forms, including .csv, however, I choose to download as .kml in order to plot the data within Google Earth. When downloading this data, any 
projections you made also come with it, which allowed me to plot the area of Asian Elephant occurrences found by iNaturalist users.</p>

<p><strong>Google Earth:</strong> Although not specifically desinged for spatial distribution analysis, as with GeoCAT, 
	Google Earth provides a free, powerful tool for mapping species distributions. Mapping species occurances requires the use of .kml files, 
	or shapefiles (.shp) to input data to the software. Here, using GeoCAT to source your data allows a .kml file to be produced, 
	which can then be imported into Google Earth, where the data can then be compared with other sources that may not have been 
	useable through GeoCAT.</p>

	<h2>Using Scientific Data</h2>
	
<p><strong>GBIF data:</strong> GBIF is an online source containing millions of records of species that have been described, often with 
the geographic coordinates, meaning they are a great source of data for spatial analysis.</p>

<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPOeK1_tsxuDBqP6OI0izs6GBlFJ2tNKxq4NDVJ2Tk_Dr5IdXkVWphWRQrKn8Mtiw?key=WWxkNWdaa2FwNTRFOFZEMGcxOExnbHRZVFpxd2x3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YY14PhhJDkqQezIdCQKRHACzMUPCnbFMgN7m6WzKKuNBMODTaaOLQ4QCqexFVY6IzUwyXGhh8BaoB2sjFvLYQ6CGZYSZDe8oqsh2nsTmJkvpPAVVFxN8rKIqf-W_RSoGy2ELnthr' /></a></p>

<p>Using data sourced from GBIF, GeoCAT was able to find 171 recordings of Asian elephants. The data has the elephants placed on the map largely where they would be expected, in Southeast Asia. However, 
there were a notable number found across Europe and North America, shown on the map below. These may be the result of recordings taken from  museum or zoo specimens.</p> 
<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPF2CosIy5IKGK5xBN29Ja51gVGhGZKCgH_a08vpkNrP2mqt6ZpNVdlXyAxIO0Ljg?key=OWg1aFh6OUNET0FrbmpLc0ZGM2FXbDg5dmRHM0t3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i7SsZJvlx36VG2zWPfN1l4inpIk1ir6eN5kTMQVyuIbySA_2LaDBO8aK5D_yEPlmHeb2rKqKwUMEIIn4' /></a></p>
<p>Therefore, it may be useful to clean the data on the map to ensure that these points are not visible. GeoCAT does provide tools to do this, however, each point must be removed 
individually, which may prove tedious when working with large datasets containing many data points recorded in areas where the species would not occur 
naturally. Therefore, it may prove useful to separate recordings on GBIF to those that are naturally occuring, and those that are museum/zoo specimens to avoid confusion when producing maps, as this may lead to incorrect 
IUCN categorisations for the endangered status of the species being produced, and a false understanding of their distributions.</p>


<p><strong>IUCN Red List:</strong> Although GeoCAT maps are used to produce Red List categorisation, data on the spatial distribution of species from the IUCN Red List was not offered through GeoCAT, and had to be downloaded through the IUCN Red List site, where it could 
be found on the map screen.</p> 

<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMsRHVdpZe8umD0Anp0SnaD0DiOCZCa7HPMDAnesTd8RI8e7HXJLI3JKf5C0WRjTQ?key=YVdURDdmelNaYUVoaF9TQWhQbmxLSnVRRng4azdB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2TquTM_OLT1DBJ7A2yCetvJp6MyFlvJymkGfmVrhfWyo9528g9eekosw7F0o4P5xJMiTT6JPiLR3wP8' /></a><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNf9vBsjfYwV72L4E78LUtqkPGBZg9iBRlqSI2Osu8FMC5f-06lQp727I9mt09Vsg?key=WHFGUWRjS29LczgteXpLLW5mMVFXd1Nhc0EzMzhn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3dHrw05DABXyclsod4aCbHIn4PBCl5sWcXi4sZTOpbaJ9ZRCQ-GjUUSOuWyORPnAZJfhUAYJd_nMkoY' /></a></p>
<p> Above is the map of Asian Elephant distributions produced by the site, showing them placed largely in India, Myanmar and Malaysia, with the location for access to the spatial data.
However, data was not easy to get a hold of, requiring log-ins, and accepting terms and conditions.
Furthermore, the data was provided in a form that could not be uploaded to GeoCAT (.csv files), as it is intended for use in GIS software, which many may not have access to.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM48vMc4Ncg9478edHw5vNPV_oft3WhuvFLl4spTUYYjVNQjSwDmzM4EuAZBFWwbQ?key=VVlFYlBtbWxZQ0w1SkhnZmwzYy1CQWFfUHh2RUdn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/30W8K27vdg86FnMs1MKMf2pjl0i0U0S3P4n1D10h_HendXv6PJFzvB4PnU2BfPuhEiIp0acFJ2ltM60nXX6_t0Qt-Pe5DOK8p0tV_lOVcBFCP3z9q869WbSgggFuJtmYXwy-zP3_vA' /></a></p>
<p>However, a shapefile was included within the dataset provided, and this could be used to map the distributions onto Google Earth.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNqL2Xh8ekP0wpy4C7oBCZWaAihrpFStc7VElDxoJTN4uQ-KVv9NFSqzkhBzXj50w?key=NXBCNEU5VXJwdWZaa3pRb0xBdGZ4eG1XSmh3X2Jn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OGFkzzoU73CQGyxoqZi0cEqv_CQcF8uK0H_GGBxmVW8QWwbdO8JqhbsR7-lbk1fdJGrXHss1zVaZV-l2NGl_Nwj1pDnuingvsxgAFd47oF3PtZkbYI6liArtnNJsmYAHA7yPIROmZw' /></a></p>
<p>Here you can see that the distributions plotted onto Google Earth are the same as those produced by the map on the IUCN's webpage, however, each area
of distribution has been given its own colour here. Therefore, although data is hard to get hold of, the maps produced from it
are largely reliable, and give very accurate descriptions of their distribution.</p>
	
<h2>Using citizen science data</h2>

<p> Citizen science data is proving increasingly powerful, and useful, to ecologists,
with various tools available, including app-based approaches, such as iNaturalist. Here, two sources of citizen science data were used, Flickr and iNaturalist. Flickr provides a 
wealth of data, however, this goes unchecked, as there is no moderator ensuring that photos tagged as a specific species are indeed the species they are claiming to be. 
iNaturalist is a social network of both citizen scientists and biologists, allowing users to upload photos and locations of species they come across, mapping 
biodiversity across the globe. Observations have to be approved to then be mapped, providing more reliable locations. </p>

<p><strong>Flickr:</strong> Flickr was the most abundant source of information of those offered on the GeoCAT mapping interface, with over 1000 observations of the species being recorded. However, you only have the option to 
upload the first 1000 observations to the map, which may limit the power of the data.</p>
<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN6OAZYbf-ELZRmHJB3GNrAKGQvL773H4LXM5Dy8_hQYx0RkPWCQZLFO_AKiKlNmA?key=VG1OcTRBTnBIR3hWN2tGQTZLZ1hmMjJEM1FPSFlR&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nz2d-eFi7Y8oE2Js0FhqCHt-JVp4SzhLViTbO6wKKH77isIiXdQAg8YfaU9YGkQbXS0D2Oz6sUuJwVDw' /></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, although many of these observations are seen where Asian elephants would be expected, as the above map shows, there were a very large number 
recorded across Europe, North America, and even Australia. Therefore, these recordings are likely to have come from zoo or museum specimens, and maps produced
using this data are likely to give unreliable results when using the analysis features provided by GeoCAT.</p>

<p><strong>iNaturalist:</strong> The GeoCAT mapping tool found 94 occurances for <i>Elephas maximus</i> sourced from iNaturalist. Furthermore, the iNaturalist data did not appear to include specimens found in zoos and museums, as all recordings were taken within 
	the species' natural range.</p>
<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNtZbpzAogzh9JdY65M8dLtpoQXSq-2mchl0kq2WnuTVCoRR1z3_X7H5ft4FPz2tw?key=d1lhOG5TeGRwTlV6T3NBOHJFNGVVdktWaWcwcFRn&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c1NJmWYk304ylQzWzdYIDwspAdwqGOZ-GyMHQB4dLzOgEcPpODKs6UxGGdyx4zSU38jE4q7Jiq780PC4' /></a></p>
<p>Therefore, this data may prove more reliable when mapping the distribution of the species in the wild. Furthermore, the analysis feature 
	on GeoCAT worked nicely for this set of data, producing results for the extent of their occurance, and their area of occupancy.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMUCyRhlTg_NIL1KmbI5crDVRu40EV3_KxkOI8cQqnM6X-eE3T0MEi551jEfLGNzw?key=eEdOVWZ0b1oxWC1sWUJ3SThBdWJkOWRtc3FOa0J3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yhKpsGqvrODeuuOSdOrgsm3wsiRax-OZEp58mYhW3qvza8YK1rIYbn2W_yl7tScPw9aKmcCcMFbfTqv2' /></a><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPvAitb6ITKazjltvS__xXr3f5An6vcG6Gojloy1K4yZ_5d_kVLekbjaRQpg3UMkw?key=d2JSNjFhXzg3R0xmSGUyUlhSZlNMLVlxMEZ3cGVB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eIYNbjbn4s17d0cl93Pe3EsRtB13jPdZkKEslGR1eb4RAcTa4efoCaJr1sSoU6fwT9YNPXp8FUR5Utmu' /></a></p>

<h2>Comparing data on Google Earth</h2>
<p>GeoCAT alls you to download the data you have been working with in .kml format, which allows you to then plot the information directly onto Google Earth. Furthermore,
this allows you to collate your data with recordings you may not have been able to upload to your GeoCAT map, such as the shapefile data retrieved from the IUCN website. 
Therefore, this allows further direct comparisons of data.</p>
<p><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipONZ0u3ENXOuufaAPBAAo9ZgLRg0tKLf4MWkQNCMI_yZoXws00nGFcj6u-ix_AVRw?key=TEN4VEdld01qMlhjc0ZHZGhlR0FKSU05dDRaMDZ3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U_8WoOX3hyTHUU4oy4MlzSOiwWSA5B7j_AJcXNCxCjP08AA5BTlGjDI9ol3J2d7pqcENyCz0B6wijAEMXr_UpctPOEjsBeNYRGRgjGi7Z-CG_IQ1sBh3bQgwuKkyVGt-rYNfXxB6' /></a></p>
<p>Much of the recordings had elephants placed across Europe and North America, however, as shown above, the data collected by iNaturalist users, 
	shown by the large blue shaded plot, overlaps quite nicely with the data collected by the IUCN Red List (the different coloured polygons). Furthermore, much of the data collected by GBIF 
	and Flickr users falls within this range, however, it would need to be cleaned to include only naturally occuring sightings before direct comparisons could be made.</p>


<h2>Further analysis</h2>
	<p> Particulary with citizen science, recordings often fall within protected areas and national parks, where tourists are 
		likely to be taking safaris and capturing images of species in their natural habitat. Furthermore, these areas often provide useful 
		study sites for researchers, as a result much of the data recorded by the likes of iNaturalist and GBIF fall into these areas. This can be further 
		explored by plotting protected areas and national parks onto Google Earth to determine whether recordings fall into these areas. 
		Data and .kml files can be easily obtained through <a href=”https://www.protectedplanet.net/” target=”_blank”>Protected Planet</a>, which can then be directly 
		mapped onto Google Earth. When examining protected areas and national parks in Southeast Asia, I could see that recordings, particularly for iNaturalist,
		often fell within these areas.</p>
	<p align="center"><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPEZbDafI7rQZYMC9lW3Lg99SGRswlekcX-ugL3sldMn6IBbE478ZCi1Vt8Vk3hkQ?key=eEw1U2RBVHl6NVlmSGZCdzRDMVZkWWJ4X2VWZXJ3&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wZopYYJuRNTQhrZjTIKll_B3Dr9GeGHS92mZ6Iw8e9oIqPgEWBba8loRP613js1OKgtMPX9QJK_RbRBu9RyzQKVV7ZoGo3v7wPCDC-OCHxiUW9SEtEBQ0LETGj117xcGIE7Ovx2YVQ' /></a></p>
	<p> The above example shows the IUCN Red List data (the red shape), and iNaturalist data (shown by the pinpoints) falling mostly within the 
		Khao Yai National Park in Thailand (the red outline). This national park is frequented by tourists hoping to see species, such as Asian 
		elephants, in their natural habitat, and therefore, it is not surprising that all iNaturalist recordings fall within this area. Furthermore, iNaturalist recordings 
	often place elephants outwith the boundaries of distribution supplied by the IUCN, therefore, this may indicate that these boundaries 
	need to be updated.</p>
	

<h2>Conclusions</h2>	
	<p> Data on the spatial distributions of species can come from a variety of sources, and increasingly, we are seeing a reliance 
		on citizen science data to obtain accurate records of species distributions. Although these are extremely helpful in mapping distributions 
		efficiently, the do have draw backs, particularly in the lack of regulation, and the misplacement of species resulting from recordings 
		from zoo and museum specimens. This can be improved by relying on data collected from more moderated sources, such as iNaturalist, although sources such 
		as Flickr should by no means be dismissed, due to the sheer volume of data collected. Therefore, more methods to clean data by natural sightings 
		and zoo/museum specimens when using platforms such as GeoCAT when mapping species distributions would be particularly helpful. Furthermore, 
		collating data from a range of sources, including scientific and citizen, allow more accurate and descriptive maps to be produced, and may therefore be more helpful 
		when trying to understand the IUCN categorisation of a species.</p>
